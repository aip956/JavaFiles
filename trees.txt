parent - child relationship between nodes
Top to bottom
multiple types of trees; graph vs. tree (depends on number of nodes; one is binary tree)
single linked list is a type of tree

Real world applications of trees:
HTML DOM; document / html // head // body
AI: decision tree
Folders in operating system; have root and different folders, subfolders
JSON format: key, value, children

first node == Root node; level 0
Children are level 1
Leaf: child with no children
connection: Edge

how to traverse tree
breadth first postorder
Depth first search: Postorder, preorder, inorder, left-right

https://leetcode.com/articles/Figures/145_transverse.png

breadth: by layers 0, then left-right
depth first:
    postorder: bottom, left, right, top, by layer
    preorder: Top, bottom, left, right
    Inorder: Left, node, right

Leetcode maxim depth of binary tree
Use breadth first; use queue
queue = []
return result = [10,6,15,3,8,20]


Add 10 to queue
while queue has any value, keep going
is there a right or left node? take out 6 from q to result
left node = 3, right = 8

binary tree preorder traversal
1. create an array that will store all the nodes to return
2. helper function which takes the node 
    check if there is a node
    push the value of the accepted node to the array    
    check if left child or right child and call that function itself
3. Invoke funciton 
4. Return result 


const preorderTraversal = root => {
    let result = []
    function preorder(node) {
        if (node) {
            result.push(node.val)
            if (node.left) preorder(node.left)
            if (node.right) preorder(node.right)
        }
    }
    preorder(root)
    return result
}
