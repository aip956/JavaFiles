coding will primarily focus on building, optimizing, and maintaining financial models, trading
1. High-Performance Computing and optimization
    Writing low-latency, high-throughput code for trading systems
    Languages: C++, Java, Rust, Python
    Concepts: Multithreading, parallel computing, vectorization, efficient memory management

2. Financial and Quantitative Modeling
    Implement pricing models, risk assessment tools, market simulators
    Langs: Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy), MATLAB, R
    Concepts: Stochastic calculus, Monte Carlo simulations, Black-Scholes model, time-series analysis

3. Data Engineering for Market Data processing
    Cleaning, storing, streamlining financial data (tick data, order books, historical prices)
    Langs: Python, SQL, Scala, C++ (for low-latency data processing)
    Concepts: Database indexing, real-time data processing (Kafka, Redis, KDB+/q)

4. Algorithmic Trading & Market Microstructure
    Developing market-making, arbitrage, and trend-following strategies
    Langs: C++, Python, Java
    Concepts: Order book dynamics, execution algos (VWAP, TWAP), latency optimization

5. Risk & Portfolio Management
    Coding risk models to measure volatility, VaR (Value at risk) and exposure
    Langs: Python, R
    Concepts: Factor models, stress testing, portfolio optimization

6. Distributed & Cloud Computing 
    Scaling computations for backtesting analytics
    Tools: AWS, Kubernetes, Spark 
    Concepts: Distributed computing, parallel backtesting, cloud-based execution 

7. Machine Learning in Quant Finance
    Applying ML for predictive analytics
    Langs: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
    Concepts: Time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning, NLP for sentiment analysis
