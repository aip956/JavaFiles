Longest Increasing Subsequence - Room 6
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).
A subsequence is a sequence derived by deleting some elements (without reordering).
Example:
vector<int> nums = {10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18};


Output: 
4 (The corresponding LIS is {2, 3, 7, 101}).
