Level 1: Basic Navigation

Display the current working directory.
pwd
Create a new directory called "exercise1".
mkdir excercise1
Navigate to the newly created directory.
cd exercise1
Create three empty files: "file1.txt", "file2.txt", and "file3.txt".
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
List all files and directories in the current folder, including hidden ones.
ls -a
Rename "file1.txt" to "newfile.txt".
mv file1.txt newfile.txt
Move "newfile.txt" to the parent directory.
mv newfile.txt ../
Delete "file2.txt".
rm file2.txt
Create a symbolic link to "file3.txt" called "symlink.txt".
ls -i gives inode 
ln -s file3.txt symlink.txt
Find all files with a ".txt" extension in the current directory.
ls *.txt


Level 2: File Manipulation and Permissions

Navigate to your home directory.
cd ~
Create a new file called "important.txt".
touch important.txt
Append the line "This is important data!" to "important.txt".
echo This is important data! >> important.txt
cat important.txt to view contents
Set read, write, and execute permissions for the owner on "important.txt".
currently -rw-r--r--
chmod u+rwx important.txt
-rwxr--r--
Create a new group called "securegroup".
sudo groupadd securegroup
Add yourself to "securegroup".
Change the group of "important.txt" to "securegroup".
Set read and write permissions for the group on "important.txt".
Deny read and write permissions for others on "important.txt".
View the permissions of "important.txt" and verify they are set correctly.

Level 3: Text Processing

Create a new file called "data.txt" with some random text.
    touch data.txt
Count the number of lines in "data.txt".
    wc -l data.txt
Display the first 5 lines of "data.txt".
    head -n 5 data.txt
Display the last 5 lines of "data.txt".
    tail -n 5 data.txt
Search for the word "Lorem" in "data.txt".
    grep "Lorem" data.txt
Replace all occurrences of "Lorem" with "Ipsum" in "data.txt".
    "sed" command
    sed -i.bak 's/Lorem/Ipsum/g' data.txt
Sort "data.txt" in alphabetical order.
    sort data.txt -o data.txt
Find unique lines in "data.txt".
    sort data.txt | uniq
Extract the second column of data from "data.txt" (assuming columns are space-separated).
    awk '{print $2}' data.txt
Save the extracted data into a new file called "extracted.txt".
    awk '{print $2}' data.txt > extracted.txt

Level 4: Process Management

Open a text editor using the command-line and leave it running in the background.

List all running processes.
    ps aux
    
Find the process ID (PID) of the text editor you opened.

Send a termination signal to the text editor process (gracefully close it).
Check the status of the text editor process to ensure it's not running.
Open a new terminal session and monitor running processes continuously (refresh every 2 seconds).
Open another terminal session and start a time-consuming process (e.g., "sleep 30").
Use a signal to pause the time-consuming process.
Resume the paused process.
Terminate the time-consuming process.

-> Be cautious when using commands like rm, kill, and rsync, as they can have permanent effects on your system or data if misused. <-

Exercise 5: Shell Scripting

Create a new shell script called "backup.sh".
Open "backup.sh" in a text editor.
Add a shebang line to indicate it should be run with Bash.
Define a variable to store the source directory you want to back up.
Define a variable to store the destination directory for the backup.
Use the "rsync" command to synchronize the source and destination directories.
Make the script executable.
Run the script and verify the files are backed up.
Add a timestamp to the backup destination directory to differentiate backups.
Test the script by modifying some files in the source directory and running the backup again.
