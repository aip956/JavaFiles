Old days: Single User Memory System
Needed to evacuate memory prior to a program using memory
But program could be bigger than memory
Simple, less memory used by the OS
One program at a time

Fixed Partition Size
Could load a second program with sufficient space in RAM
If you filled memroy, could not run any more programs and had to reboot to free up RAM
