Old days: Single User Memory System
Needed to evacuate memory prior to a program using memory
But program could be bigger than memory
Simple, less memory used by the OS
One program at a time

Fixed Partition Size
Could load a second program with sufficient space in RAM
If you filled memroy, could not run any more programs and 
had to reboot to free up RAM

Memory Management System
Process size, kB requirements, and Process time, fragments
But not dynamic; can't readjust size of blocks

Dynamic, Adjustable Blocks
Allows use of multiple apps, but limited program size if more
RAM needed

Virtual Memory
Can split memory into slices; pages
Page frames; segments of memory
Can store out of sequence
Page number vs. memory address
Memory Map: more virtual memory than physical memory
map pieces in use with pieces that can be put in RAM
Can have a bigger program than RAM

32bit vs 64bit
bits = number of pins in the chip
CPU with more bits = higher throughput

Max number represented by bits
1 bit number = 2 combos (0, 1)
2 bit number = 4 combos (00, 01, 10, 11)
3 bits = 8 combos
2^n (n=num of bits)
32 bits = 4GB RAM
64 bits = can access "unlimited" quantites of RAM

Processor:
4 -> 8bit -> 16 bit -> 32 bit (386) -> 64 bit Xeon
Bits processor can access

ReadyBoost VM; could use USB as RAM
